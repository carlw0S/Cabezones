A (sassy) clone of certain football game I'm pretty fond of ;)

Since the original game is from an online minigame page, it is kinda awkward to play, and performance isn't very nice either, so I decided to remake it from scratch in Unity (it's my first project, so it probably is a mess, but I guess it is somewhat playable lol)

Right below you can find several builds for Windows I've being doing from the start if you want to see the evolution somehow, since my first commit starts at version 0.7 :(

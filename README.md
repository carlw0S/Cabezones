# Cabezones
A (sassy) clone of certain football game I'm pretty fond of ;)

Since the original game is an online Flash game, it is kinda awkward to play, and performance isn't very nice either, so I decided to remake it from scratch in Unity (it's my first project, so it probably is a mess, but I guess it is somewhat playable lol)
